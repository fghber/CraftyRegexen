# Overlapping Matches

Using a matching group in a lookahead, and then consume one character to move forward, e.g.

**nn**nn  
n**nn**n  
nn**nn**  

```
(?=(nn))n
```
The innner pattern can be as complex as the regex engine supports it:
```
(?=(\d+\D+\d+)).
```
Swap the pattern in the lookahed as needed.

However, using a lookahead with a capturing group works, at the expense of making your regex slower and more complicated. An alternative solution is to tell the `Regex.Match()` method where the next match attempt should begin. In Java/.NET, it would look like this:
```
Regex regexObj = new Regex("nn");
Match matchObj = regexObj.Match(subjectString);
while (matchObj.Success) {
    matchObj = regexObj.Match(subjectString, matchObj.Index + 1); 
}
```
